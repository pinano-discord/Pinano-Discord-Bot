# Pinano Bot

This is the open source for the Pinano discord bot. The bot serves to track stats and help out in the Pinano discord community.

## Contributors

All help is welcome, if you have anything to improve you can either open an **issue** or you can submit a **pullrequest** directly.

The bot is written in Javascript using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

To start developing, you should install [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) to ensure you
use the same version of Node as other developers. There are instructions at the link above. However,
if you just want to jump in without install `nodenv`, make sure you look at [`.node-version`](.node-version)
for the current version we are using.

PS - You must have mongodb installed and running.
